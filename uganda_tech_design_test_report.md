# Uganda Tech & Design Platform - Functional Testing Report

**Test Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Platform URL:** https://07vwj4fvqpc9.space.minimax.io  
**Tester:** AI Testing Agent  

## Executive Summary

The Uganda Tech & Design platform testing revealed multiple critical issues that prevent normal user functionality. While basic authentication flows work after creating new accounts, the core educational features (3D tools, curriculum, assessments, notes) are either completely non-functional or severely compromised.

**Overall Status:** ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED** - Platform requires immediate technical attention

## Test Results Overview

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Homepage Loading | ✅ Pass | Low |
| Login System | ⚠️ Partial | Medium |
| 3D Tools | ❌ Critical Failure | High |
| Curriculum Navigation | ❌ Broken | High |
| Assessment System | ❌ Broken | High |
| Notes Functionality | ❌ Broken | High |

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Homepage Loading ✅
**Status:** PASS  
**Details:** The platform loads correctly and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page as expected. This is standard behavior for educational platforms requiring authentication.

### 2. Login System ⚠️
**Status:** PARTIAL PASS with Issues  

**Issues Identified:**
- **Demo Account Non-Functional:** The provided demo credentials (`student_demo`/`Pass123!`) do not work
  - First failure: Invalid email format error (system requires email, not username)
  - Second failure: After trying `student_demo@demo.com`, received "Invalid login credentials"
  
**Workaround:** Successfully created a new test account which allowed platform access

**Recommendation:** Fix or update demo account credentials, or remove demo account section if not maintained

### 3. 3D Tools ❌
**Status:** CRITICAL FAILURE  

**Issues Identified:**
- Page loads completely blank with no content
- **Console Errors Detected:**
  ```
  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'customDepthMaterial' of undefined
  WebGL: CONTEXT_LOST_WEBGL
  ```
- Three.js library errors indicate broken 3D rendering functionality
- This appears to be the source of cascading application failures

**Impact:** Core educational feature completely non-functional

### 4. Curriculum Navigation ❌
**Status:** BROKEN  

**Issues Identified:**
- Page stuck in infinite loading state
- Navigation becomes unresponsive after 3D Tools error
- Unable to access any curriculum content

**Root Cause:** Likely related to cascading JavaScript errors from 3D Tools section

### 5. Assessment System ❌
**Status:** BROKEN  

**Issues Identified:**
- Page stuck in infinite loading state
- Cannot access assessment features
- Navigation unresponsive

**Root Cause:** Same cascading failure affecting all post-login functionality

### 6. Notes Functionality ❌
**Status:** BROKEN  

**Issues Identified:**
- Page stuck in infinite loading state
- Cannot access notes features
- Part of the application-wide failure

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue appears to be a **cascading JavaScript failure** originating from the 3D Tools section:

1. **Initial Trigger:** Three.js/WebGL errors in 3D Tools component
2. **Propagation:** Unhandled JavaScript exceptions break the single-page application's routing
3. **System Impact:** All subsequent navigation becomes non-functional

### Browser Console Errors
- **Three.js Material Error:** `Cannot set property 'customDepthMaterial' of undefined`
- **WebGL Context Loss:** `CONTEXT_LOST_WEBGL` - indicates graphics rendering failure
- **Authentication Warning:** Expected console message for unauthenticated sessions (normal behavior)

## Critical Issues Summary

### High Priority (Immediate Action Required)
1. **3D Tools Complete Failure** - Core educational feature non-functional
2. **Application-Wide Routing Failure** - Renders platform unusable after initial error
3. **Demo Account Credentials** - Provided login information is invalid

### Medium Priority
4. **Error Handling** - Unhandled JavaScript exceptions cause cascading failures
5. **WebGL Compatibility** - Graphics rendering issues need investigation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Fix Three.js Implementation:** Debug and resolve the `customDepthMaterial` property error
2. **Resolve WebGL Issues:** Investigate graphics context loss and implement fallbacks
3. **Implement Error Boundaries:** Add JavaScript error handling to prevent cascading failures
4. **Update Demo Credentials:** Fix or remove non-functional demo account information

### Short-term Improvements
5. **Add Loading States:** Replace infinite loading with proper error messages
6. **Browser Compatibility Testing:** Test WebGL support across different browsers
7. **User Experience:** Add graceful degradation for users without WebGL support

### Long-term Considerations
8. **Monitoring:** Implement client-side error tracking for production issues
9. **Testing:** Establish automated testing for critical user paths
10. **Documentation:** Update user guides to reflect actual working credentials

## Testing Environment
- **Browser:** Chromium-based browser with full JavaScript and WebGL support
- **Network:** Stable internet connection
- **Authentication:** Used newly created test account after demo credentials failed

## Conclusion

The Uganda Tech & Design platform has significant technical issues that prevent its use as an educational tool. While the basic infrastructure (authentication, page loading) works, all core educational features are currently broken due to unhandled JavaScript errors. 

**Priority:** This platform requires immediate technical intervention before it can be used by students or educators.
